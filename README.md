## Machine Learning for Cyber Security
### Topic: [Cybersecurity](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-cyber-security/blob/main/mls-cyber-security.ipynb)

Course material for the ``Machine Learning for Cyber Security`` module provided by Ricardo A. Calix, PhD at Purdue University Northwest (Chicago) and author of [[``Getting Started with Deep Learning: Programming and Methodologies using Python``](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Deep-Learning-Methodologies/dp/1542567092/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=getting+started+with+deep+learning&qid=1560485670&s=gateway&sr=8-3)].

## Prerequisites

- Require Python to be loaded on your local machine. Recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Execute Jupyter Notebook

- The software must be downloaded and run on a machine as follows:

	- Clone the repository with the following command:

	``git clone https://github.com/SeanOhAileasa/mls-cyber-security.git``

    - Run Jupyter Notebooks from the command line with the following:

	``jupyter notebook``

    - Open notebook - ``mls-cyber-security.ipynb``

    - Once running within the Jupyter environment can navigate with ease - links are plentiful.

	- ***Notebook links will not work on github given that github renders as static HTML - also not able to view equation tag numbers. Please run on a local machine or use nbviewer (see below).***

- An alternative to downloading and running on a local machine with all features included (links/equation tag number etc) can view via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-cyber-security/blob/main/mls-cyber-security.ipynb).
